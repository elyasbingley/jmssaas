# Setup: provisioning the real services

The repo is scaffolded against placeholder config. Nothing runs until you provision
your own Supabase project, PowerSync instance, and (later, for email/calendar) a
Google Cloud OAuth client, and fill in the resulting values in `apps/mobile/.env`.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node 20+, pnpm (`corepack enable` will pick up the pinned version)
- The [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your phone (fastest way to test on a
  real device), or Xcode/Android Studio for a simulator
- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account
- A [PowerSync](https://powersync.com) account (free tier is fine for Phase 1)

## 2. Create the Supabase project

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. Under **Project Settings > API**, copy the **Project URL** and **anon public** key -
   you'll need these for `apps/mobile/.env`.
3. Run the migrations against your project. Easiest via the Supabase CLI:

   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR-PROJECT-REF
   npx supabase db push
   ```

   This applies everything in `supabase/migrations/` in order: the schema, RLS
   policies, and the `job-files` storage bucket + its policies.

4. Seed the Phase 1 tenant row:

   ```bash
   npx supabase db execute -f supabase/seed.sql
   ```

   (Or paste `supabase/seed.sql` into the SQL Editor in the dashboard.) This inserts
   one `tenants` row with a fixed id (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`) for
   Bingley Roof Consulting - referenced below when creating your admin account.

## 3. Create your admin account

Phase 1 has no public sign-up (by design - see the core requirements). You create
accounts directly via the Supabase Admin API, which also lets you set
`tenant_id`/`role`/`full_name` in `raw_user_meta_data` so the `handle_new_user`
trigger (in `20260720000100_init_schema.sql`) provisions the matching `profiles`
row automatically.

Run this once (Node, with your **service role key** - Project Settings > API -
never ship this key in the app):

```js
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  "https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co",
  "YOUR-SERVICE-ROLE-KEY" // service_role, not anon - keep this out of the app/repo
);

await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: "you@example.com",
  password: "choose-a-password",
  email_confirm: true,
  user_metadata: {
    tenant_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
    role: "admin",
    full_name: "Elyas Bingley",
  },
});
```

Repeat with `role: "technician"` for each tech's account once you're ready to add them.

## 4. Create the PowerSync instance

1. Sign up at [powersync.com](https://powersync.com) and create a new instance,
   connecting it to your Supabase project (PowerSync's Supabase integration guide
   walks through the exact steps - it needs read access to your Postgres database
   via a replication slot).
2. In the instance's **Sync Rules** editor, paste the contents of
   `powersync/sync-rules.yaml` and deploy it.
3. Copy the instance's connection URL (Instance > Edit instance) for
   `apps/mobile/.env`.

## 5. Fill in `apps/mobile/.env`

```bash
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env
```

Fill in the three `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values from steps 2 and 4. These are safe to
expose in the client bundle (anon key + PowerSync endpoint, both meaningless
without a valid RLS-scoped session).

## 6. Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter mobile dev
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or press `w` in the terminal to open the web build
(useful for a quick check without a device - remember the "desktop app" later on
is this same web build wrapped in Tauri).

## 7. Try the vertical slice

1. Sign in with the admin account you created in step 3.
2. Create a client, then a job card for that client.
3. Open the job card, add a note, and attach a photo (camera or library).
4. Turn on airplane mode and repeat - notes, job cards and photos should all
   still work; photos show "Syncing..." until they upload.
5. Turn airplane mode back off. Within a few seconds the queued writes and
   photo should sync to Supabase - check the `job_cards`/`job_notes` tables and
   the `job-files` storage bucket in the dashboard to confirm.

## Known gaps / next steps

- **Desktop (Tauri)**: not scaffolded yet by design (see the mobile-first
  decision on this branch) - the plan is to wrap this same Expo web build once
  the core workflow is validated on mobile.
- **Quotes, invoices, tasks UI, calendar, Gmail/Calendar integration**: the
  database schema, RLS policies and PowerSync schema already cover Phase 1's
  full scope, but only the client -> job card -> notes/photos vertical slice has
  screens built. These are office/PC workflows and were intentionally left for
  a follow-up pass rather than being scaffolded speculatively.
- **`react-native-worklets` peer warning**: `pnpm install` reports an unmet peer
  range from `expo-modules-core`. This sandbox's network policy blocks the Expo
  CLI's compatibility-check endpoint, so `npx expo install --fix` couldn't be run
  to reconcile it here - run it once you have normal network access to pick the
  exact version Expo SDK 57 expects.
- **PowerSync attachments API**: `apps/mobile/lib/attachments.ts` and the
  `AttachmentTable` in `packages/shared/src/powersync/schema.ts` use
  `@powersync/common`'s built-in attachment queue, which is still marked
  `@experimental`/`@alpha` upstream as of v1.57. Pin the PowerSync version
  deliberately when upgrading and check their changelog for breaking changes
  to this API specifically.
